# Minesweeper
A React.js project

The project is a simple re-creation of the game Minesweeper, which became popular through the Microsoft version released in 1990.

In the game a grid is populated with a varying amount of tiles. Some of which are acceptable to click, and some that are not. The goal is to find the tiles that are not acceptable to click.
The project includes several react components that are interactable and serve to pass variables between one another to progress in the game.
This project was create to display profficiency in working with basic **Javascript** concepts like arrays, loops, conditionals. As well as **React** components, state, and interaction between elements through recursion.
